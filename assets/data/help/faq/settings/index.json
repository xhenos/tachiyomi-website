We know that speed is being sacrificed but it's better than not being able to access a source at all.\n\n## Tracking\n\n### How do I log in with Kitsu?\nTo log in with Kitsu you need to use your email address as your username.\n\n## Application Updates\n\n### How do I enable automatic updates?\nFrom version **0.9.0** and onwards, Tachiyomi has automatic updates for the app enabled by default.

To whitelist Tachiyomi from battery saver, go to <Navigation item=\"more\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings\"/> → <Navigation item=\"settings_advanced\"/> and click on **Disable battery optimization**.\n\n## User Interface\n\n### Can I change the app language?\n**Tachiyomi** is translated in 40+ different languages.
