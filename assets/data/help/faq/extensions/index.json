Rather, we encourage users to spend some time to try out a few sources themselves, and discover what sources work best for them. It's because what works well for somebody else, might not work well for you.\n\n`<ElAlert type=\"info\" title=\"Disclaimer\" description=\"Tachiyomi is not hosting any content, we are not affiliated with or responsible for any source that is; slow, down, missing chapters, or has subpar image quality.\" show-icon :closable=\"false\"></ElAlert>`\n\n### What are scanlator sources?\nManga that are not officially licensed are translated by scanlators, who either publish manga on their own website or **MangaDex**.
