Meaning updating status in Tachiyomi will update the tracker, but updating status in the tracker will not update Tachiyomi\n\n## Setting up Tracking <MaterialIcon icon=\"sync\" />\n\n### Logging in to trackers\n\n:::guide Guide\n:::videolink\n[<MaterialIcon icon=\"videocam\"/> Click for video guide](/assets/guides_tracking_login-to.mp4)\n:::\n1.
