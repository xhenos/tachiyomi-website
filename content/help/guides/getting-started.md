* Some sources use **Japanese romanized** titles instead of **English** ones.
  > For example **Boku no Hero Academia** instead of **My Hero Academia**.
* Some sources use different spellings.
  > For example **Bungo Stray Dogs** instead of **Bungou Stray Dogs**.
* Some sources use different wordings
