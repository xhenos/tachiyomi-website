# Frequently Asked Questions

## Application

### Library

#### How can I see how many chapters I've downloaded?
This can be done by enabling **Download badges** under `<Navigation item="library"/>`.

::: guide
Enable it by going to `<Navigation item="library"/>` → `<Navigation item="filter"/>` → **Display** section and then checking the **Download badges** option at the bottom.
:::

#### Why are some covers white after restoring from backup?
The URL to the cover has probably changed. To fix this, refresh the metadata of your library.

::: guide
Refresh your metadata by going to `<Navigation item="more"/>` → `<Navigation item="settings"/>` → `<Navigation item="settings_advanced"/>` then pressing **Refresh library metadata**.
:::

#### How do I ignore chapters from certain scanlator groups?
Every now and then you find a manga that is translated by more than one group. Because of this, you get multiple releases for each chapter in the manga. The easiest way to fix this is to change sorting to **Total chapters**. You won't see any changes but, when you start reading you'll automatically skip the duplicate releases.

::: guide
Change library sorting by going to `<Navigation item="library"/>` → `<Navigation item="filter"/>` → **Sort** section then in this case selecting **Total chapters**.
:::

### Browse

#### Why can't I find X manga?
Sometimes you can struggle to find a source hosting the manga you're looking for, look here for some tips to help you find it.
::: guide Tips to find your manga
1. Look up the title on [Google](https://google.com/) or a manga database such as [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/).
1. See if a website or scanlator has the series, then check the [Extensions](/extensions/) list.

#### If you found the website/scanlator in the list
Download the corresponding extension, go to the source, then search for the manga there.
#### If you didn't find the website/scanlator in the list
If you found a website or scanlator that hosts your manga but doesn't exist as a source or extension, then you can see if its [already been requested](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi-extensions/issues) or you can [request it yourself](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).

If the website/scanlator group doesn't have an online manga reader, you can download the manga manually and set up [local manga](/help/guides/reading-local-manga).
:::

### Reader
#### Why are some images not displayed?
Aside from network issues, it could be because the images are too big or that the decoder doesn't support that image type.

### Downloads
#### What happened to the simultaneous downloads feature?
It was removed to prevent IP bans caused by too many requests. We know that speed is being sacrificed but it's better than not being able to access a source at all.

#### Why are Downloads unstable?
Be aware that it could be a network issue on your device or on the catalog you are trying to download from.

#### Can you make it possible to store manga on both internal storage and external SD-card?
At the moment, no. You could try using symlinks but that requires having your phone rooted.
::: note

### Tracking
#### How do I log in with Kitsu?
To log in with Kitsu you need to use your email address as your username.

#### Why can't I find manga in MAL's search results?
You can search a manga from your MAL profile's list by searching in the following format: `my:<manga>`
::: note

:::

### Local Manga
#### How do I import my manga into Tachiyomi?
We recommend you to read [this](/help/guides/reading-local-manga) guide on how to do so.

#### What do I do if I can't find the Tachiyomi folder?
If you don't see a **Tachiyomi** folder on your device, try downloading a chapter of any manga or creating a backup so that the folder can be created.

### Application Updates
#### How do I enable automatic updates?
From version **0.9.0** and onwards, Tachiyomi has automatic updates for the app enabled by default. The **Preview** version also has automatic updates enabled by default.

However, if you think you are on an outdated version, go to `<Navigation item="more"/>` → `<Navigation item="about"/>` → and click on **Check for updates**.

#### Why are automatic updates not working?

Certain devices such as MIUI have very aggressive battery saving, which can kill the app in the background. To whitelist Tachiyomi from battery saver, go to `<Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/>` and click on **Disable battery optimization**.

### User Interface
#### Can I change the app language?
**Tachiyomi** is translated in 40+ different languages. By default, the app follows the language used on your device.
Only the UI has been localized, the language of the manga will still be using the language of the source selected.

::: guide
You can change language by going to `<Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_general"/>` then pressing **Language**.
:::

### Miscellaneous

#### What is Tachiyomi Preview?
It's a weekly updated version of the app. It contains features that can be added to Tachiyomi in the future, but there is a higher chance for bugs. Tachiyomi Preview is used by developers and contributors to test the app and find bugs.

If you are willing to use Tachiyomi Preview, be sure to [turn on auto-backup](/help/guides/creating-backups/#turning-on-auto-backups) to prevent losing your library due to potential bugs.

#### Why can't I uninstall Tachiyomi?

On **Android 10**, a bug was introduced which prevented users from uninstalling the app if the phone had a MicroSD card. To fix the issue, please remove the MicroSD card from the phone first, then uninstall Tachiyomi.

#### Will there be an iOS version?
There is no iOS version and no plans for one. Since iOS and Android apps don't share code it's hard to port.

#### Will Tachiyomi ever be on the Google Play Store?
Due to Google Play's content policy, almost certainly not, as they do not allow the APK system to work. The content on some sites will lead to Google taking it down at some point, and Inorichi does not want to have to deal with it as they have stated [before](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi/issues/1745#issuecomment-441208074)

#### How can I report Tachiyomi copycats on the Google Play Store?
If you're on desktop, fill out [this](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/takedown) form following [these](https://pastebin.com/08eeuJxH) steps.

#### Can Tachiyomi read Light Novels?
No. Tachiyomi is an image parser, meaning it can't parse text.

#### Can I revert back from the Material Design 2 update of Tachiyomi?
While there will never be a toggle between the two UI versions, you can continue to use the old UI version by using [TachiyomiAZ](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/TachiyomiAZ/).

#### Will there ever be a dual-page reader option?
The logic required to make a dual-page reader automatically work along with scanlator page inconsistencies and other issues means it is unlikely to be added at this time.

#### I see manga images in my phone gallery, what gives!?
Tachiyomi by default adds a `.nomedia` file to prevent this from happening but sometimes it doesn't work or something went wrong. To fix this, all you need to do is create the file yourself. Name it `.nomedia` and place it in your download folder.

#### I lost everything, what now?
To avoid data loss in the future, you can use the automatic backup feature.

## Extensions

### General

#### What are some recommended extensions?
Tachiyomi does not endorse or recommend any manga source, and there is no best extension. Rather, we encourage users to spend some time to try out a few sources themselves, and discover what sources work best for them. It's because what works well for somebody else, might not work well for you.

`<ElAlert type="info" title="Disclaimer" description="Tachiyomi is not hosting any content, we are not affiliated with or responsible for any source that is; slow, down, missing chapters, or has subpar image quality." show-icon :closable="false"></ElAlert>`

#### What are scanlator sources?
Manga that are not officially licensed are translated by scanlators, who either publish manga on their own website or **MangaDex**. Scanlator sources always provide the fastest manga updates and have the highest scan quality.

Some popular scanlator sources are  **MerakiScans**, **Hatigarm Scans** and **Leviatan Scans**. (in **Genkan** extension)

Learn more about scanlation in this **Wikipedia** [**article**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanlation).

#### Which sources are in the multi-source extensions?
Some extensions contain multiple sources, look at the list below to find out which extension to install for the specific source that you want.

::: guide
User [SnakeDoc83](https://github.com/snakedoc83) has made a handy spreadsheet showing the different multi-source extensions and their sources.
::: note
Access the spreadsheet [here](https://tachiyomi.org/extensions-spreadsheet)
:::

#### How do I request a new extension?
Open an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi-extensions/issues) if one does not already exist.

::: note
You can find the list of extensions to download [here](/extensions/)
:::

#### Why won't the extensions install?
In some cases your phone might have some issues downloading the extensions, in those cases you can try installing them yourselves directly from the source.

To install just download the file for the extension you want and then install it, like how you installed **Tachiyomi**.

#### How do I allow third-party installations?

When installing your first extension and are prompted that your phone *isn't allowed* to install unknown apps from that source, simply follow the prompt to allow it.

In *newer* versions of **Android** you need to enable **Install unknown apps** by a per-app basis.

It might be because the title is worded differently. Follow any of the steps below:
- Look up the title on a search engine like **Google** or a manga tracking service such as [AniList](https://anilist.co/home).
- See which site has the series, often a single source will not satisfy all your needs.

:::

If you're not getting any results when searching **MangaDex** then you need to log in. To do so enter the `<Navigation item="webview"/>` for **MangaDex** then press the **Manga** drop-down and choose either **Sign up** or **Log in** to proceed with the login.

::: guide
To enter the **WebView** go to `<Navigation item="browse"/> → <Navigation item="button_latest"/>` next to **MangaDex**, then press on `<Navigation item="webview"/>` in the top right corner.
:::

#### Why is MangaDex slow?
If pages are loading slowly or not at all, try:
- Making sure you have the *latest* version of the extension.
- Checking if **MangaDex** is either down, or is having the same issues.
- Trying to **Clear database** under `<Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/>`.
- Trying to **Clear chapter cache** under `<Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/>`.

#### Is there an alternate searching method?
**MangaDex** allows you to search using the ID number to find manga. The easiest way to get the ID is by opening the manga in your browser and looking at the URL.

::: guide
An example search would be **`id:23427`** which would return results for [Candy & Cigarettes](https://mangadex.org/title/23427/candy-cigarettes)
:::

#### How do I deal with duplicate chapters in MangaDex?
This can be solved by opening **MangaDex** in `<Navigation item="webview"/>` and block the scanlator group whose chapter you don't want to see.

#### How do I fix chapters from Mangaplus being broken?
Install the **MANGA Plus by SHUEISHA** extension instead and then migrate the manga that uses **MANGA Plus** on **MangaDex** onto the **MANGA Plus** source.

::: note
Read about source migration [here](/help/guides/source-migration/)

### MangaPark

#### How do I deal with duplicate chapters in MangaPark?
To solve this issue, follow the below steps.

1. Go to `<Navigation item="browse"/> → <Navigation item="extensions"/>`.
1. Click on **MangaPark** extension and then **Chapter List Source**.
1. Choose an option like **Smart list** or **Prioritize source**.
1. Go back to **MangaPark**'s chapter list and refresh it.

### Mangabox

#### What does `Page list is empty` mean?
**Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** have created new entries for manga on their sites again. Some old entries are obsolete and will not work. To resolve this, [migrate](/help/guides/source-migration/#source-migration) the manga from **Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** to another source.

#### What does `Source URL has changed` mean?
This means that the manga is dead and needs to be migrated from **Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** to a different source. Refer to the guide for **Page list is empty** above.

#### How do I fix the `Image could not be decoded` error?
Open the manga in WebView and wait for the image to comes up. If the image isn't loading you will need to look elsewhere to read that particular manga, as some Mangabox sources, such as Mangakakalot, are now blocking entire regions.

### Webtoons.com

#### How do I fix the `Page list is empty` error?
You will have to open the manga entry in WebView and verify your age, as Webtoons has recently added age verifications on their site.

### Japscan

#### Why are some Japscan chapters not loading?
Japscan has some manga that are scrambled using a different algorithm than others on their site. If you encounter a manga being scrambled, use a different source to read.
