## General

### What are some recommended extensions?
Tachiyomi does not endorse or recommend any manga source, and there is no best extension. Rather, we encourage users to spend some time to try out a few sources themselves, and discover what sources work best for them. It's because what works well for somebody else, might not work well for you.

:::alert Disclaimer
Tachiyomi is not hosting any content, we are not affiliated with or responsible for any source that is; slow, down, missing chapters, or has subpar image quality.
:::

### What are scanlator sources?
Manga that are not officially licensed are translated by scanlators, who either publish manga on their own website or **MangaDex**. Scanlator sources always provide the fastest manga updates and have the highest scan quality.

Some popular scanlator sources are  **MerakiScans**, **Hatigarm Scans** and **Leviatan Scans**. (in **Genkan** extension)

Learn more about scanlation in this **Wikipedia** [**article**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanlation).

### Which sources are in the multi-source extensions?
Some extensions contain multiple sources, look at the list below to find out which extension to install for the specific source that you want.

### Why won't the extensions install?
In some cases your phone might have some issues downloading the extensions, in those cases you can try installing them yourselves directly from the source.

To install just download the file for the extension you want and then install it, like how you installed **Tachiyomi**.

When installing your first extension and are prompted that your phone *isn't allowed* to install unknown apps from that source, simply follow the prompt to allow it.

In *newer* versions of **Android** you need to enable **Install unknown apps** by a per-app basis.
